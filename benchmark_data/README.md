# benchmark_data

The databases contained in this package are generated from the datasets provided by KavrakiLab's [MotionBenchMaker](https://github.com/KavrakiLab/motion_bench_maker) with [yaml_to_warehouse](https://github.com/mamoll/yaml_to_warehouse).

Currently two benchmark databases are available:

1. panda_kitchen_test_db.sqlite: 10 queries in the MotionBenchMaker's kitchen environment with different difficulties
2. panda_test_db.sqlite: Full dataset of different environments and difficult planning problems for the Panda robot
